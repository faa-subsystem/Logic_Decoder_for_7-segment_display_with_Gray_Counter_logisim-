# Logic_Decoder_for_7-segment_display_with_Gray_Counter_logisim
A Gray counter circuit is a type of digital circuit that can count in a specific sequence where only one bit changes at a time, unlike a traditional binary counter which changes all the bits. Gray code is a binary code where two successive values differ in only one bit position, making it ideal for use in rotary encoders, computing and communication systems, and other applications requiring precise control and synchronization of signals.

The basics of a Gray counter circuit involve using a series of flip-flops or registers, combined with logic gates, to create a circuit that can increment or decrement based on a specific input signal. Each flip-flop represents a bit of the Gray code, and the logic gates determine when each bit should change based on the input signal.

To decode the Gray counter, a decoder circuit is required that takes the Gray code input and produces a binary output. The decoder circuit uses combinational logic to convert the Gray code into binary code as the counter increments or decrements. One common decoder circuit is the Karnaugh map, which uses Boolean algebra and truth tables to derive the output signals for each of the binary bits.

Overall, a Gray counter circuit is an efficient and effective way to count in a specific sequence, with minimal complexity and more straightforward decoding compared to a traditional binary counter.
